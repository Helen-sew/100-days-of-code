### Day 1: December 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript DOM, revising on DOM Selection, Traversing and Events. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
